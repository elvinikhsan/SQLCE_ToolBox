# SQL Script Collection

## Overview

This notebook contains custom SQL scripts and tools, as well as scripts which are collected from external sources and shared for everyone. This notebook hopefully would make it easy to find useful script during support activities. All are encouraged to share their on the job SQL scripts for diagnostic, troubleshooting and performance tuning or anything that is deemed helpful to others. Feel free to contribute and share using this notebook. 

## Tips

-   Make sure to check for existing script with similar result returned to avoid duplication of the same script or functionality.
-   You can use the standard CTRL + F to find keyword.
-   If there is similar script that is doing similar function, whenever possible please try to update and enhance the existing script first.
-   Avoid using lengthy and complex script, the simpler the better, as long as it does the job.
-   If you do have to share a very useful but complex script, perhaps it is better to create a new sub-folder in this Teams channel files tab and create another Jupyter (SQL) Notebook for it. For example: Implementing Automatic Sliding Window Partitioning.
-   To keep this notebook size small, before saving the file, please don't forget to clear all results (click on the **Clear Results** icon on the top right corner). 

Thank you!
